Wordics creates colorful word clouds from the text in your blog. They are summaries of your blog posts in the way search engines would do them.

== Description ==

Wordics is a plugin that generates colorful word clouds from text. The sizes of the words in the cloud are different. 
They depend upon the importance of the words which is measured by their frequency in the text compared to their 
natural occurrence in the language. 

You may easily embed Wordics in your blog. There are two options for it:

1. As a sidebar widget that displays a word cloud from the page that contains it. This is cool if you want your readers
to see a short summary of what you have written. The word cloud also represents the way how search engines look at
your page. Basically, they pick up statistically the most important words in it and use them to index it. The word 
cloud may help you to find out what search phrases might be relevant to your pages, for example.

1. As a popup over the links in your post. In this case a small HTML popup will appear above the links
in your post when somebody hovers them. It will contain a word cloud from the text in the page that the link
points to. This is useful if you want your readers to see quickly a short summary of the pages the your links are
pointing without actually opening these pages in the browser. It looks similar to a snapshot of the pages but is
far more informative because it summarizes the text in them in few meaningful words instead of displaying 
a simple thumbnail that nobody can read.

Of course, you may use both of the above options.
